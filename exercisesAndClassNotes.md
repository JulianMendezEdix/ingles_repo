### Exercise 1.1 Information technology 

"

*IT Department Restructuring*

*DataPro Inc is growing, and so our workload is increasing. But our IT department is not dealing with the increase effectively. So, I am dividing the IT department into three sections: quality assurance, data processing and information security. The responsibilities of each section are:*

*QUALITY ASSURANCE: Testing hardware. Providing technical support.*

*DATA PROCESSING: Writing code. Organizing data.*


*INFORMATION SECURITY: Encoding online data transfers. Updating security software.*

These changes are not simple or easy. But smaller groups deal with tasks more efficiently than larger ones. See your supervisors to your new section assignment.*

"

####A. Before you read these passage talk about these questions:

#####1. What is Information Technology?

MY ANSWER: 

When we talk about Information Technology, we talk about dealing with data and information in a automatic way, more specifically, with computing process. All the specific areas that bring us solutions and procedures to process data with computers in an automatic way is our Information Technology.

CHATGPT TEACHING: 

Your answer provides a general understanding of Information Technology (IT), but there are some grammar and clarity improvements that can be made. Here's a revised version with suggestions for improvement:

"When discussing Information Technology (IT), we refer to the automated management of data and information, particularly through computing processes. Information Technology encompasses various specific fields that provide solutions and procedures for processing data automatically using computers."

Improvements and explanations:

"When discussing Information Technology (IT)," - This phrase clarifies the context and makes your introduction more precise.

"we refer to the automated management of data and information," - This rephrasing makes the definition more concise and clear.

"particularly through computing processes." - This phrase adds specificity to how IT operates.

"Information Technology encompasses various specific fields" - This highlights that IT is not just one thing but consists of several specialized areas.

"that provide solutions and procedures for processing data automatically using computers." - This part of the sentence elaborates on what IT does and how it achieves its goals.

By making these changes, your answer becomes more concise and easier to understand while retaining the key points about Information Technology.
