Iv seen an entry in Reddit named "Is Spain really that bad for software engineers?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/1168cib/is_spain_really_that_bad_for_software_engineers/?rdt=46168

Some persons are commenting his ideas about working in Spain as a software engineer. 

In the first comment, one person says that salaries are really good for spanish standards, but they are incredibly low if you compare them with another north european countries. Also it speaks about sub-contracted companies, with no good working conditions in his opinion (no stability, no good salary).

Another comment talks about similar scene in Portugal.
